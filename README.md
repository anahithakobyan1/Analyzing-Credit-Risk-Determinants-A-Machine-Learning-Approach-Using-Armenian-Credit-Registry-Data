# Analyzing-Credit-Risk-Determinants-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-Using-Armenian-Credit-Registry-Data

In recent years, the increased availability of datasets among financial institutions gave an opportunity for banks and credit organizations to improve their risk management strategies by analyzing credit risk determinants. The challenge of predicting customer defaults accurately continues to be an important study for those institutions that aim to optimize their credit allocations and minimize their losses. This paper explores the application of advanced machine learning techniques to model and predict default probabilities for consumer loans among bank customers in Armenia. Utilizing the dataset from the Armenian Credit Registry, this study systematically identifies and evaluates the most influential features leading to customer defaults. Given the complexity and variability of factors influencing credit risk, traditional statistical methods fail to capture the patterns in the data. Hence, this research implements three machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost, which offer distinct advantages in handling large, diverse datasets with complex relationships among variables. Through a comparative analysis of these models, the study aims to determine which model most effectively predicts default among loans and understand the relative importance of various predictors in the credit scoring process.
The effectiveness of these models is evaluated and compared using metrics like AUC scores, ROC curves, F1 scores, accuracy scores, and confusion matrices.
